#April 
### "Acute Melancholy is noticeable in those who have gone a long way into this matter, whereas a light giggling, dancing fancy seems to support those in the very first stages; brief of thought; cut of concentration; a tendency to hop, skip and jump, and to misplace the eye at every single or several manifestation of girl in like distemper.
### Chill succeeds, and Restlessness at Night....
### This gives place in from six to eight weeks to a sobriety that includes thoughts of transmigration, levitation, myopia, and blight, The eye trickles, the breath is short, the spleen is distended, and the epiglottis rises and falls like the continual swallowing of the heart."

### "Acute Melancholy is noticeable in those who have gone a long way into this matter, whereas a light giggling, dancing fancy seems to support those in the very first stages; brief of thought; cut of concentration; a tendency to hop, skip and jump, and to misplace the eye at every single or several manifestation of girl in like distemper.Chill succeeds, and Restlessness at Night....This gives place in from six to eight weeks to a sobriety that includes thoughts of transmigration, levitation, myopia, and blight, The eye trickles, the breath is short, the spleen is distended, and the epiglottis rises and falls like the continual swallowing of the heart."

I believe this excerpt from "April" of _Ladies Almanack_ is listing these characteristics and moods of a woman like that of symptoms written on a prescription. Many different medicines list the side effects, like shortness of breath or loss of apetite. Barnes seems to be structuring her chapter like this. 
I think the chapter is exaggerating the lifestyle of a woman who loves another woman. Homosexuality was a risky subject and still seems to make people uncomfortable today. I think Barnes is comparing homosexuality to a disease, not because she agrees with the thought, but because so many around her treat other women's private affairs as such. By treating a different way of life as something that needs healing, Barnes could perhaps be poking fun at the way people see homosexuality. She is making fun of the old way.

Below is an example of symptoms one will need to seek medical attention for:

For internal evidence, I used some phrases from "March." Quotes like "shall make of one a wife and the other a bride" and "woman falls in this age to woman" show that a central theme of Barnes's book is homosexuality. In "January", Barnes creates a character named Patience Scalpel to represent the old, traditional, narrow-mindedness ways of the past. Through these internal quotes, Barnes connects her chapters for this one theme. 

In "March", one character also asks, "What has England done to legalize these passions? Nothing!" Through the internet, I found that same sex marriage was legalized very recently (in the past 3 years). I used this phrase for my external evidence. I used _Readerâ€™s Guide to Lesbian and Gay Studies_ from Harner's guide. The guide is a very large book that contains over 400 entries on the subject of homosexuality. This guide can lead you to other books that talk about the specific subject. Murhpy provides a small summary of their point of view on the subject and their own book title. I went to the topic of marriage in the guide, and read that many authors side with Barnes and find it ridiculous that same sex marriage is such a large hurdle. One author discusses benefits couples would have if they were legally married and calls same sex marriage "natural and just." Barnes would have this same view.

#Question 1

Although in class, we discussed that April may be linked to the feeling of new love, rather than homosexuality specifically,
I will still research and answer questions linking to the specific theme, instead of love in general. 

    Hardwynn’s question (Taylor also asked a similar one) asked if Barnes linked symptoms in support or against homosexuality. 
I believe Barnes is in favor of it personally and shows through this chapter that is mocking people who are against it. 
For internal evidence, I used some quotes from June. Dame Musset was going on a walk with her love; Barnes describes 
her with “Doll on her arm.” In the previous chapter, Musset was boasting about her past life as a “pioneer “ and 
“daring as a crusade.” These titles have positive connotations and Musset holds them with pride.She is not ashamed of 
her love for Doll or women in general. By writing Musset as a strong savior to all women, Barnes is pushing her thoughts 
for the acceptance of homosexuality through her.

   For external evidence, I used an article I found by searching “Djuna Barnes” in the Literature Resource Center 
on Harner’s site. The article is called "Lullaby for a lady's lady": Lesbian identity in 'Ladies Almanack’ by Kathryn Kent. 
Kent says Barnes’ book is “a continuation of society's reaction and an intervention into that reaction.” Kent confirms the
idea that Barnes is against homophobia through this simple sentence.

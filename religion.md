# Religion in Literature

Although in class, we discussed that April may be linked to the feeling of new love, 
rather than homosexuality specifically, I will still research and answer questions
linking to the specific theme, instead of love in general. 


    Anna asked “Do you believe Barnes is using the 
    characters to portray modern day problems between
    the church and LGBTQ community?”

For my external evidence, I used the same website as the previous question, 
  but changed my search to “homosexuality church” hoping that would give me results 
  for the history of religion in social issues, like the nature of marriage. I used 
  “The stained glass closet: celibacy and homosexuality in the Church of England to
  1955” by Timothy Jones. He states “Christian institutions have variously been charged 
  with repressing, policing, and regulating understandings of sexuality.” Barnes would
  have understanding of the control of the church, and that impacted her writing. The 
  article said the 1920s and 1930s showed shifts to understanding and becoming more open 
  with sexuality. Jones’ examples were books on contraception being published and Freudian 
  psychology on sexuality. Barnes’ book would have fit right in with these new shifts in society. 
  Society was trying to move on, accepting love and bodies, but the church overall was not
  happy with the change, still encouraging celibacy for some. Barnes lived through this 
  important shift, and used her talents to write about homosexuality in a time where the 
  subject was controversial to the holiest of people.

For my internal evidence, I think Patience Scalpel represents people in the church that 
  look down on homosexuality. These “ways” “were about her, above her, and before her”, 
  meaning Scalpel and narrow-minded people. In February, Barnes writes through Musset
  referring to God as the only person who would know her fate when she catches her love. 
  Through short references like these, Barnes can indirectly write about the closed minds 
  of the church towards people with different lifestyles. I think she ties this in with
  her disease-like chapter in April. People in the church would believe that homosexuality 
  is a sin and disease that should be terminated. By structuring her chapter that way and 
  using small references throughout her book, Barnes pokes fun at the church and takes a 
  stand for homosexuality.

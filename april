##Acute Melancholy is noticeable in those who have gone a long way into this matter,
whereas a light giggling, dancing fancy seems to support those in the very first 
stages; brief of thought; cut of concentration; a tendency to hop, skip and jump, 
and to misplace the eye at every single or several manifestation of girl in like 
distemper.Chill succeeds, and Restlessness at Night....This gives place in from 
six to eight weeks to a sobriety that includes thoughts of transmigration, levitation,
myopia, and blight, The eye trickles, the breath is short, the spleen is distended,
and the epiglottis rises and falls like the continual swallowing of the heart."

I believe this excerpt from "April" of Ladies Almanack is listing these characteristics 
and moods of a woman like that of symptoms written on a prescription. Many different 
medicines list the side effects, like shortness of breath or loss of apetite. Barnes
seems to be structuring her chapter like this. I think the chapter is exaggerating 
the lifestyle of a woman who loves another woman. Homosexuality was a risky subject 
and still seems to make people uncomfortable today. I think Barnes is comparing 
homosexuality to a disease, not because she agrees with the thought, but because so 
many around her treat other women's private affairs as such. By treating a different
way of life as something that needs healing, Barnes could perhaps be poking fun at the 
way people see homosexuality. She is making fun of the old way.

Below is an example of symptoms one will need to seek medical attention for:
